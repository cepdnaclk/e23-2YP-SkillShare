# Skill-Share by ZenWare 🚀

**An Algorithmic Peer-to-Peer Knowledge & Resource Sharing Platform**

Skill-Share is a campus-oriented, full-stack web application designed to help students connect and share their skills, knowledge, and resources. Developed by **ZenWare**, this project aims to bridge the gap between students who want to learn and those who can teach, using smart algorithms to make collaboration easier.

## 📖 Project Overview
In many university environments, students have unique skills and learning needs, but they often struggle to find the right people to help them. Current methods for finding tutors or study partners are often slow and inefficient. 

**Skill-Share** solves this by providing a dedicated platform where students can:
* **Discover Peers:** Find students nearby with specific skills or shared interests.
* **Match Efficiently:** Use smart logic to connect multiple users (e.g., A teaches B, B teaches C, and C teaches A).
* **Sync Schedules:** Automatically find common free time slots to avoid manual coordination.
* **Build Trust:** Use a rating system to ensure reliable and high-quality mentorship.

## ✨ Key Features
Our platform is built with a focus on core engineering concepts and data structures to ensure a smooth experience:

* **Smart Matching & Scheduling:** Automatically detects skill-sharing cycles and identifies overlapping free time for meetings.
* **Search & Discovery:** Features instant search suggestions and location-based discovery to find active users near you.
* **Real-Time Interaction:** A built-in chat system for instant communication and group messaging.
* **Trust Score System:** A reliability rating for mentors based on peer feedback and endorsements.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices with a single codebase.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
We use modern technologies to ensure our system is scalable and secure:

* **Frontend:** React.js (for the user interface) and Leaflet.js (for location mapping).
* **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot (for managing data and logic).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for reliable data storage) and Redis (for fast caching).
* **Real-Time:** WebSockets (STOMP) for low-latency messaging.

## 🎯 Conclusion
Skill-Share by ZenWare is more than just a tutoring app. It is a technical solution that applies algorithmic thinking to real-world collaboration problems. Our goal is to create a more connected and efficient learning community for students everywhere.
